This project was done for educational purposes only
The objective of this project was to get some information at the FIDE -  International Chess Federation [website](https://www.fide.com/directory/affiliated-organizations)
related to the affiliated organizations displayed.
Since the site talks to an API to show the results, the url link dont change, so i had to use Selenium to work around that.

Here a sample of the results
